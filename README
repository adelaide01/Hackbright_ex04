List Operations
Python 2.7.1
Fourth exercise from Hackbright Academy
===============

There are two files, list_operations.py and test_list_operations.py. 
Run "python test_list_operations.py" at the CLI prompt. 

The test_list_operations.py file contains tests for the functions defined in
list_operations.py. All the tests are failing because none of the functions are
implemented correctly. Your job is to write correct implementations for all the
functions in list_operations.py.

To check your work, you can run the test_list_operations.py file at any time to
get information on the currently failing tests. The failures will be listed in
alphabetical order by function name.
